this is a simple project for a clinic management app where the doctors have existing accounts that they can login and the patients can either register or login if they have an existing account.
The patient can type their medical history for the doctors to see and can book an appointment with the doctors whenever they are available.
The doctor can add a walk in patient and it shows to the doctor that this person got added as a walk in not from the original patient page,
the doctor can also cancel or update any appointments however they like.
